# Introduction 
[AutoPanoStitch](https://github.com/preethamam/AutomaticPanoramicImageStitching-AutoPanoStitch) image stitching datasets compilation: A compilation of image stitching datasets from USC during my Ph.D. days and other open source providers.


# Image stitching datasets description
Creating image stitching datasets takes a lot of time and effort. During my Ph.D. days, I tried to compile datasets that were comprehensive to have `spherical`, `cylindrical` or `planar` and full view `360 x 180-degree` panoramas. These datasets posed a real challenge to the automatic stitching method. If all these datasets are stitched well, it definitely shows the robustness of your stitching method.

All these datasets are public! Some of them were from my Ph.D. studies (especially on cracks) and most of them were downloaded from the internet. I do not remember the individual names of the dataset providers. But I acknowledge their work and I am thankful to all of them! I hope you appreciate their efforts in making these datasets public to advance the research!

Below are some samples from the datasets. There are 85 `panorama` or `image stitching/registration` datasets in total. You can download them in [AutoPanoStitch Stitching Datasets Compilation](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqjW7B7BO7JJgdB7hSu2vu8OOefG4Q). If I come across any interesting and challenging datasets, I will expand this compilation.
